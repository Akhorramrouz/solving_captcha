# solving_captcha
this project goal is to be able to solve different kind of captchas using computer vision techniques


## collect the data 

the first step in this project is to gather a wide variety of captchas from differenet sources

## preprocess the data
in this step we are going to preprocess the data

## build a model(preferably CNN) and train it
having all the data the goal is to create a model which is able to recogonize different letter and numbers individually

## fine tune the pre-trained model
fine tune the model for different sources of captcha
