# solving_captcha
this project goal is to be able to solve different kind of captchas using computer vision techniques
 when you surf net you might be asked to solve captchas to prove you are not a robot.
 What if robots learn to do so?? It seems to be fantastic, dosen't it?? :)

## collect the data 

the first step in this project is to gather a wide variety of captchas from differenet sources

## preprocess the data
in this step we are going to preprocess the data

## build a model(preferably CNN) and train it
having all the data the goal is to create a model which is able to recogonize different letter and numbers individually

## fine tune the pre-trained model
fine tune the model for different sources of captcha
